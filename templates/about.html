    The Department of Surgery is an important clinical department that has existed since the inception of the college of
    medicine in 1975. The Department provides continuous services through specialized outpatient clinics and general
    clinics through which surgical cases are referred. The Department also provides services 24 hours a day, seven days
    a week, to care and intervene in emergency and trauma cases. In addition to general surgery, the department includes
    specialized specialized divisions such as plastic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, pediatric surgery, and
    neurosurgery, all of which play a prominent role both for patients and in medical education. The department also
    provides surgical care to outpatients. In addition, the department provides clinical training for medical, nursing,
    and dental students, interns, residents and fellows.
